# **Case Study:** California Department of Developmental Services (DDS)

In the United States, individuals with developmental disabilities typically receive services and support from state governments. The State of California allocates funds to developmentally-disabled residents through the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS); individuals receiving DDS funds are referred to as "consumers". The dataset “dds_data.csv” represents a sample of 1,000 DDS consumers (out of a total population of approximately 250,000), and includes information about age, gender, ethnicity, and the amount of financial support per consumer provided by the DDS.

A team of researchers examined the mean annual expenditures on consumers by ethnicity, and found that the mean annual expenditures on Hispanic consumers was approximately one-third of the mean expenditures on White non-Hispanic consumers. As a result, an allegation of ethnic discrimination was brought against the California DDS. Does this finding represent sufficient evidence of ethnic discrimination, or might there be more to the story?
