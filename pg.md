**Case Questions**

1. Why do you think P&G decided to develop data science capabilities in-house? Why not outsource these capabilities to a consulting company that specializes in data analytics?
2. How should Peri integrate data scientists into P&G? Should he place them on a centralized team that serves the entire business or embed them on individual business teams?
3. What are the benefits and costs of centralizing data into a single data lake instead of managing data separately in hubs? How do you maintain the integrity and clarity of the data in the lake when it is coming from so many different sources?
