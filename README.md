The Data Science for Managers (DSM) course is primarily managed across three different platforms:
  1. The course website, which serves as the textbook for the course. This contains readings, videos, and coding exercises that students work through outside of class. The materials for this site are contained and managed in this Github repository.
  2. Google Drive, which is used to manage the Colab notebooks and polls that we use in the course.
  3. Canvas, which is used to manage assignments and announcements. 

This README describes best practices for managing materials across all three of these platforms.

All Colab notebooks and Google Polls for the course are managed on Google Drive. The account above is the primary owner of all of these materials.

### Managing Access with Google Groups

It is important to carefully manage access to all materials on the Google Drive folder for the course. Faculty and members of the course admin team should have *edit* access to most materials on the folder, while teaching fellows and students should have *view* access. This can be managed using Google Groups, which allow one to change access rights to large groups of users based on a single group address. To see the Google Groups owned by the DSM faculty account, go to [https://groups.google.com/my-groups](https://groups.google.com/my-groups) and make sure you are logged in under the dsmfaculty@gmail.com account. You should see something like the following:

You will manage users through three different groups: 

+ **DSM Faculty**, which contains all faculty and members of the course admin team who need to directly edit materials on the Drive folder. 
+ **DSM TFs**, which contains all teaching fellows for the course who need to review (but not directly edit) materials on the Drive folder. 
+ A group for the students enrolled in the course. In the screenshot above you can see various groups created for different iterations of the course; try to keep the naming convention consistent.

#### Adding New Users to Google Groups

Adding new users to these groups is straightforward. Click on the group you want to add members to, and then click the "Members" bar under "People" on the left-hand pane of the screen. This will open a list of all members currently in the group. Then, click "Add members" at the top of the page, which will open a window. Within this window paste the gmail addresses of all users into the "Group members" bar (you can paste many addresses at once). Make sure you activate the slider to "Directly add members". Finally, click "Add members", and the added users will now be a part of the group. This means all of these users will have access to any materials that the group has access to. *See* the gif below for a depiction of all of these steps.

#### Sharing Materials with Google Groups

Once you have organized all users into different Google Groups, you can manage their access to all course materials on Drive. The DSM folder has already been shared with the DSM Faculty group *with edit access*, and with the DSM TFs group *with view access*. You can see the access permissions of a folder or file by right-clicking it in drive and selecting "Share":

When you share a folder with an individual user or a group on Drive, all files and sub-folders within that folder are also shared *unless you explicitly revoke access to the file or sub-folder*. 

Because materials are distributed to the students incrementally as the course progresses, you do *not* want to share the entire course folder with the group that contains the enrolled students. Instead, you will need to share each file with the student group when it is time for that file to be released to the students. Of course, you should always grant the student group View access and *not* Edit access. To share an individual file with the students, right-click it and select "Share", then share with the address of the Google Group. Make sure you uncheck "Notify people" before sharing so that the entire group will not be notified every time you share a file with them. For example:
