**Case Questions**

1. Why did the Warriors invest in data science?
2. In addition to Exhibit 5, what other data would be useful in modeling customer types? How else could you improve this model? Could this model be used to predict the customer type for customers who have never been to a Warriors game?
3. How would you use the predicted customer types to improve ticket sales?
4. How would you measure the impact of the ticket timing model? Was this a successful data science project?
