## Class 0: R Bootcamp

Work through the ***R BOOTCAMP*** section of this book. This will introduce you to the basics of R.
+ The DSM course is designed for students from all backgrounds, including those with extensive coding experience and those with no coding experience at all. For students coming into the course with less experience, the R Bootcamp is designed to framiliarize you with the basics of coding in R. The fundamentals introduced in the bootcamp will form the foundation for the skills you will learn throughout the course. 
+ To get credit for the bootcamp, you must complete the three quizzes embedded throughout ([here](rbasics_quiz1.html#quiz-#1), [here](rbasics_quiz2.html#quiz-#2), and [here](df_manipulation_quiz.html#quiz)). If you already have experience with the basics of R you do not need to work through the bootcamp, but you must still submit these quizzes.

## Class 1: Introduction to Data Science

**Before Class**

1. Complete the [experience poll](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJw7jtiGG1retC-YIX0y8wPAhdjl0H5JGc30yvOfyLmCoZEQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). 

2. Read the *Data Science at the Warriors* case [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FZj5nyrP28JmgZJTYVVhV5lb0z7L8XOh/view?usp=sharing) and prepare the following case questions:
	+ Why did the Warriors invest in data science?
	+ In addition to Exhibit 5, what other data would be useful in modeling customer types? How else could you improve this model? Could this model be used to predict the customer type for customers who have never been to a Warriors game?
	+ How would you use the predicted customer types to improve ticket sales?
	+ How would you measure the impact of the ticket timing model? Was this a successful data science project?

**During Class**

At the start of class, launch the code notebook for the Warrior's case [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Fxl66IQNLgv1BbKfocDG-j85nnDRvYOG?usp=sharing). **Note** that this notebook will not be live until the start of class.

## Class 2: Managing Data Science (I)

**Before Class**

Read the *Data Science at Target* case [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LU1LpGltN8-Sd0HVYfapk7hjl8T45LyQ/view?usp=sharing) and prepare the following case questions:

+ The most basic description of the four areas on which Desai focused when he first joined Target suggest that even a small data science operation is a big investment in terms of hardware, talent, and organizational learning (case pages 2-3). Does it make sense for Target to hire Desai in 2013 to pursue data science as an important part of its strategy? What is the business case?
+ How do you reconcile the “learning and experimentation” model of develop-test-measure with delivering “relevant” and “curated” content for on-line digital personalization?
+ When Desai’s team first reached out to business units in search of questions where data science might be useful, he did not require them to utilize “big data” (*i.e.* look for patterns to explore in the data). Why not? Do you agree?
+ Should business information analysts who are Enterprise Data, Analytics, and Business Intelligence (EDABI) Group’s primary customers be embedded in business units or sit closer to the data sciences group?
+ Should the tools that EDABI develops be flexible or structured? What does an empowered managerial class mean for the data scientists and engineers building the tools?
