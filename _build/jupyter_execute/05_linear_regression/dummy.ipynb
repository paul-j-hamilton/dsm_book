    "# Dummy Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have been modeling `Salary` as a function of `Age` and `Rating`, which are both quantitative variables. However, there are also categorical variables in our data set that we might want to include in the model. For example, we might be interested in exploring whether there is a gender bias in our salary data. To do this, we need to somehow include `Gender` as an independent variable in our regression. However, this variable is not measured numerically; it takes on the values \"Male\" or \"Female\". How, then, can we include it in our regression model?\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we need to create a **dummy variable**, or a binary, quantitative variable that is used to represent categorical data. Dummy variables use the numeric quantities `0` and `1` to represent the categories of interest. In our case our categorical variable is `Gender`, so our dummy needs to encode one of the genders as `0` and the other as `1`. (Note that it is largely arbitrary which category we assign to `1` and which we assign to `0`.) Let's create a new variable in our data set called `male_dummy`, which equals `1` if the employee is male and `0` if the employee is female:"

    "Dummy variables are relatively straightforward for *binary* categorical variables such as `Gender`. But what about a variable like `Degree`, which can take on several different values (`\"High School\"`, `\"Associate's\"`, `\"Bachelor's\"`, `\"Master's\"`, and `\"Ph.D\"`)? It might be natural to assume that you could just assign a unique integer to each category. In other words, our dummy for degree could represent \"High School\" as 0, \"Associate's\" as 1, \"Bachelor's\" as 2, \"Master's\" as 3, and \"Ph.D\" as 4. However, this method of coding categorical variables is problematic. First, it implies an ordering to the categories that may not be correct. There might be an ordering to `Degree`, but consider the `Division` variable; there is no inherent ordering to the divisions of a company, so any ordering implied by a dummy variable would be arbitrary. Second, this method of coding implies a fixed difference between each category. There is no reason to believe that the difference between an associate's and a bachelor's is the same as the difference between a bachelor's and a master's, for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "How, then, do we incorporate multinomial categorical variables into our regression model? The answer is by creating separate 0 / 1 dummy variables for each of the variable's categories. For example, we will need one dummy variable (`DegreeAssociate's`) that equals `1` for observations where `Degree` equals \"Associate's\", and `0` if not. We will need another dummy variable (`DegreeBachelor's`) that equals `1` for observations where `Degree` equals \"Bachelor's\" and `0` if not, and so on. The table below shows how all possible values of `Degree` can be represented through four binary dummy variables:\n",
