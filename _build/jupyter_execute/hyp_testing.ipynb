    "# Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "An important component of inference is **hypothesis testing**, which allows us to analyze the evidence provided by the sample to assess some claim about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ A **one-sample hypothesis test** compares a single population parameter to a specified value. For example, you may wonder whether your local barista pours a full twelve ounces of coffee in each cup. By drawing a sample of the cups poured by your barista, you could use a one-sample hypothesis test to answer this question. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ A **two-sample hypothesis test** assesses the equality of parameters from two different populations. For example, you may wonder whether the barista near your home and the barista near your work pour similar amounts on average, or if one pours more than the other. By drawing a sample of the cups poured by each barista, you could use a two-sample hypothesis test to answer this question. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Formulating Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing consists of setting up two hypotheses, called the **null hypothesis** ($H_{o}$) and the **alternative hypothesis** ($H_{a}$). It is important to note that these hypotheses must be formulated *before* any data are observed. In the one-sample case, the null hypothesis specifies a specific value of the population parameter of interest. In the one-sample barista example above, the null hypothesis would be that on average, the barista pours twelve ounces of coffee. In the two-sample case, the null hypothesis specifies that the two parameters of interest are equal. In the two-sample barista example above, the null hypothesis would be that on average, the two baristas pour the same amount of coffee. \n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative hypothesis in the one-sample case expresses how the population parameter may differ from the value specified in the null. In some cases, we simply hope to test whether the population parameter is *not equal* to the value specified in the null; this is referred to as a **two-sided** test because we will reject the null hypothesis if the finding from the sample is sufficiently greater than or less than the specified value. In other cases, we hope to test whether the population parameter is *greater than* (or *less than*) the value specified in the null; these are referred to as **right-sided** (and **left-sided**) tests, respectively. For example, in the one-sample barista example the alternative is that the true average amount poured is not equal to twelve ounces, so we would run a two-sided test. If we wanted to specifically test whether our barista pours *more than* twelve ounces, we would run a right-sided test. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the two-sample case, a two-sided alternative hypothesis would state that the two population parameters are not equal. The right-sided alternative hypothesis would state that the population one parameter is greater than the population two parameter, and the left-sided alternative hypothesis would state the opposite. In the two-sample two-sided barista example, the alternative is that the two baristas do not pour the same amount, on average. If we wanted to test whether the home barista poured more than the work barista, we would run a right-sided test (or a left-sided test, depending on which barista we arbitrarily assign as 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Logic of Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In a hypothesis test, we start by assuming the null hypothesis is true. We then gather our evidence (data from a sample). Based on the evidence we can draw only one of two inferences: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ **reject** the null hypothesis $H_{o}$, or\n",
    "+ **fail to reject** the null hypothesis $H_{o}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the data indicate we should \"reject $H_{o}$,\" we can say that it is likely that $H_{a}$ is true. If instead the data indicate we should “fail to reject $H_{o}$”, we conclude that our sample did not provide sufficient evidence to support $H_{a}$. Note that based on sample data, we can never *accept* the null hypothesis. We can only conclude that we have insufficient evidence to reject it. This distinction is subtle but important.\n",
    "\n",
    "The language of hypothesis tests is a bit arcane, so it can be useful to look at a concrete analog.  In the U.S. jury system, the defendant is assumed innocent unless proven otherwise.  That is, the null hypothesis is that the defendant is innocent.  Based on trial evidence, a jury can only\n",
    "\n",
    "+ reject the null hypothesis that the defendant is innocent (that is, find that the defendant is guilty) or\n",
    "+ fail to reject the null hypothesis that the defendant is innocent (that is, the defendant is acquitted).\n",
    "\n",
    "The jury cannot conclude that the defendant is innocent (that is, that the null hypothesis is true), only that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the defendant is guilty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulating the null and alternative hypotheses is a challenging part of hypothesis testing. One begins by identifying an assertion about a population parameter and then translating the assertion into symbols. We give some examples of this process below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Suppose that an airline company claims that the average weight of checked baggage is less than 15 pounds. To support the claim, the airline company conducts a random sample of 150 passengers and finds that the average weight of checked baggage is 14.2 pounds, with a standard deviation of 6.5 pounds. Do these data indicate that the average weight of checked baggage is less than 15 pounds? State the null and alternative hypotheses for this problem. Note that $\\mu$ is the symbol for the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The first sentence contains an assertion about the population parameter: “the average weight of checked baggage is less than 15 pounds.” Because this is the assertion we wish to support with evidence, we write the alternative hypothesis ($H_{a}$) as $\\mu < 15$ . This then implies that our null ($H_{o}$) is $\\mu = 15$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Consumer Reports wants to compare the average lifetime for two brands of incandescent light bulbs. Specifically, it would like to test whether there is a difference between the average lifetime of bulbs made by each of the two companies. State the null and alternative hypotheses for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** In symbols, let $\\mu_{1}$ represent the average lifetime of bulbs of Company 1 and $\\mu_{2}$ represent the average lifetime of bulbs of Company 2. Consumer Reports wonders whether there is evidence to suggest that the mean lifetime is different for the two companies, so the alternative hypothesis ($H_{a}$) would be that $\\mu_{1} \\ne \\mu_{2}$. Our null ($H_{o}$) is then $\\mu_{1} = \\mu_{2}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The P-Value\n",
    "\n",
    "The question remains of how to decide, based on our sample data, whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. This is done using probability theory by calculating what is called a **probability value**, or **p-value** for short. The p-value is always between 0 and 1 and indicates how consistent our observed  sample is with the given null hypothesis.  The higher the p-value, the more consistent our sample is with $H_{o}$; the lower the p-value, the more consistent our sample is with $H_{a}$. (Technically, the p-value tells us, if the null hypothesis is true, what the likelihood is that we would obtain a sample that is “as extreme” as the sample we gathered. Thus, a high p-value indicates that it is quite likely we would obtain a sample as extreme as ours if the null hypothesis is true, a low p-value indicates that it is unlikely we would obtain a sample like ours if the null hypothesis is true.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We designate a threshold value for a p-value called a **significance level**, typically denoted **$\\alpha$**. The convention is to set $\\alpha$ = 0.05, but more generally, the choice of $\\alpha$ depends upon the problem context (*e.g.*, a test comparing a new drug to an existing drug might  use a very small $\\alpha$, whereas a test of a minor change might use a larger $\\alpha$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the p-value is an involved mathematical exercise; for our purposes, we will simply read it from the R output. We formally use the p-value to interpret the test results as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ If p-value $\\le \\alpha$ we reject the null hypothesis and say our result is statistically significant.\n",
    "+ If p-value $> \\alpha$ we fail to reject the null hypothesis and say our result is not statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what sense are we using the word *significant*? Webster’s Dictionary gives two interpretations of significance: “(1) having or signifying meaning; or (2) important or momentous.” In statistical work, significance does not necessarily imply momentous importance. For us, “significant” at the $\\alpha$ level has a special meaning. It is the likelihood (or “risk”) that we reject the null hypothesis when it is in fact true.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some P-Value Cautions\n",
    "\n",
    "The American Statistical Association issued an advisory article in 2019 urging caution in how p-values are used [@PVal-cautions]. In fact, many users of statistics interpret p-values incorrectly. The p-value is not the probability that the null hypothesis is true. That would actually be a very useful value to have, but unfortunately we usually don't have the ability to find it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value is a conditional probability that says “assuming the null hypothesis is true, how likely is it that we would draw a sample as unusual (*i.e.*, \"extreme\") as ours?” It does not say, “given our data, what's the chance our null hypothesis is true”, which is a source of confusion for many people. The safest way to think about a p-value is as a measure of consistency. Given my observed sample data, is it consistent with my null hypothesis view of the world? If not, then I will reject that null view of the world and conclude that the alternative view is likely the correct one.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "The p-value is not the probability that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type I and Type II Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of a hypothesis test is to make the correct decision about $H_o$. Unfortunately, hypothesis testing is not a simple matter of being right or wrong. A test of hypothesis is based on sample data and probability, so there is always a chance that an error has been made. In fact, there are two primary errors one can make:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ A **Type I error** is made if we reject $H_o$ when in fact $H_o$ is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ A **Type II error** is made if we fail to reject $H_o$ when in fact $H_a$ is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis test is calibrated so that the probability of making a Type I error equals $\\alpha$. If we choose a significance level ($\\alpha$) of 0.05, this means there is a 5% chance that our hypothesis test will mistakenly reject $H_o$, given that $H_o$ is actually true. \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of making a Type II error is denoted $\\beta$. For a fixed sample size, the probability of making a Type I error ($\\alpha$) and the probability of making a Type II error ($\\beta$) are inversely related; as $\\alpha$ is increased, $\\beta$ is decreased, and vice versa. Therefore, $\\alpha$ cannot be arbitrarily small, since $\\beta$ likely will then become large.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, the process of hypothesis testing allows you to control the risk of a Type I error\n",
    "because you set the value for $\\alpha$. However, (ordinarily) you do not have the same control over $\\beta$, or the probability of failing to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false. For this reason, it is best to avoid making Type II errors. Therefore, rather than “accepting” $H_o$ when the sample data fail to provide sufficient evidence to overturn $H_o$, we instead say we “fail to reject” $H_o$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing the Appropriate Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The process we have described so far is common to all forms of hypothesis testing. We always start by defining null and alternative hypotheses, then calculate a p-value from those hypotheses using sample data. However, the statistical test we use to calculate the p-value depends on the type of data we are working with. In R, the appropriate command depends on:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Whether you are conducting a one-sample, two-sample, or more-than-two-sample test\n",
    "+ Whether you are comparing means or proportions\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining sections demonstrate how to conduct the appropriate test in R for each one of these scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "## One-Sample Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a one-sample hypothesis test when we want to compare a population parameter to a specified value. The following are all examples of scenarios where a one-sample hypothesis test would be appropriate:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ An automobile manufacturer received a shipment of light bulbs from a supplier, and would like to verify that less than 2% of the bulbs are defective.\n",
    "  + Is the true proportion ($p$) less than 0.02?\n",
    "+ We would like to determine whether the majority of the electorate support the Democratic candidate for president.\n",
    "  + Does the true proportion ($p$)  exceed 0.50?\n",
    "+ A food processing plant received a truckload of chickens from a local farmer, and needs to verify that the average chicken weighs at least two pounds. \n",
    "  + Does the true mean ($\\mu$)  exceed 2 lbs?\n",
    "+ A software company wants to determine whether its users interact with the homepage for at least ten seconds, on average. \n",
    "  +  Does the true mean ($\\mu$) exceed 10 seconds?\n",
    "  \n",
    "The first two examples concerned questions about population proportions ($p$), whereas the second two questions concern population means ($\\mu$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Means\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate a one-sample test of means, let's return to our `employees` data set. Suppose that the HR department of the company is thinking about re-calibrating the employee performance scale, which is currently measured from one to ten. If the scale were calibrated properly the average score would be around five, but the team suspects there might be some \"rating inflation\" occurring. To investigate this, they would like to test whether the average employee `Rating` is greater than five. Under this scenario, the null and alternative hypotheses are:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ $H_o$: The true average rating of all employees at the company is five.\n",

Following the same logic, `alternative` should equal `\"less\"` for a left-sided test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our null hypothesis states that $\\mu$ equals five, so we set the `mu` parameter equal to five in the function call. Additionally, because our alternative hypothesis states that the population mean is *greater than* the value specified in the null, we are conducting a right-sided test and must set the `alternative` parameter equal to `\"greater\"`.\n",

    "\n",
    "To illustrate a one-sample test of proportions, let's focus on the second example from Section \\@ref(one-sample-hypothesis-testing). Suppose we would like to determine whether the majority of the electorate supports the Democratic candidate for president. Our null and alternative hypotheses would then be:\n",

For instance, a company may want to know if a new logo produces more sales than the previous logo, or a consumer group may want to test whether two major brands of food freezers differ in the average amount of electricity they use. In this section we extend our knowledge of hypothesis testing on one population mean to comparing two population means.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use these tests you need to have a sample from each of the two populations of interest. For the tests to be valid, the samples must be randomly selected. They can be either independent or dependent. This is an important distinction, because it determines which statistical method is used and how one controls for sources of variation. **Independent samples** are selected from each population separately. If we selected a random sample of customers of one domestic gas supplier and a random sample of customers from a rival gas supplier, the samples would be independent. **Dependent samples** consist of matched or paired values that are inherently related to each other. If we selected a sample of athletes and compared their pulse rates before and after an exercise routine, the samples would be paired, or dependent, because we drew the two samples of observations from the same set of athletes. This allows us to control for the variability between athletes and focus on the pulse rate difference in each individual due to the control condition (*i.e.*, the exercise routine). The choice of independent or dependent samples depends on the context of the test. \n",

The simplest example of paired data is a before-after test, in which each subject is measured twice, resulting in pairs of observations of the same subject.

We can't analyze these data as two independent samples because we have two measurements (pairs of data) on the same individual. We need to adjust our hypothesis test to account for the fact that the measurements are correlated. \n",

A company researcher wants to test a new formula for a sports drink that has been designed to improve running performance.

The researcher would like to know whether this new carbohydrate-protein sports drink leads to a difference in running performance compared to the carbohydrate-only sports drink.\n",

In the other trial, each of the same 20 participants drank a bottle of the carbohydrate-protein formula. At the end of the two trials, the distance each participant ran (in km) was recorded.

    "\n",
    "The two-sample t-test described earlier requires that the two samples be independent and random, and thus is not the right statistical test procedure for this example. Certainly, the independence requirement was violated by the manner in which the experiment was conducted. Each pair of measurements, a carb-only distance and carb-protein distance, is associated with the same runner. A glance at the data will show that the distances are of approximately the same magnitude for a particular runner, but vary from one runner to another. This, of course, is exactly what we might expect. Distance run, in a large part, is determined by a runner's stamina and muscle mass. Since each runner had a different physical ability, we might expect a large amount of variability in the distance run from one runner to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are interested in performance variability due to the drink and not runner variability, we must conduct a **paired difference test**. This test eliminates the effect of the runner-to-runner variability and yields more information on the mean difference in the distances run for the two drink types.\n",

The four service centers the company runs are organized by regional markets. One question of interest is whether the employees’ training is similar in the four different markets so that the install time is roughly consistent around the country. Builder's Buddy collected data from these four different markets on the amount of time it took (in minutes) to install a standard 40-gallon water heater.
