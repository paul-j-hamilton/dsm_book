    "# Atomic Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have seen how to create variables that store a single value only. However, in practice we almost always work with sets of many different values. To work with this type of data in R we can create an **atomic vector**, which stores a set of one or more values of the same type. There are two important components to this definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Atomic vectors can store one or more values, meaning an object that stores just a single value is an atomic vector. This means that every object we have created so far (*e.g.*, `myFirstTextVar`) has been an atomic vector. Below we will see how to create atomic vectors with more than one value.\n",
    "+ Atomic vectors cannot mix data types. This means you could not have an atomic vector with numbers *and* characters, for example. Note that `NA` (which indicates a missing value) is *not* considered a distinct data type, so you can have atomic vectors that contain values of a particular data type as well as `NA`s. \n",
