    "In the previous chapter we saw how to create atomic vectors, which can store one or more values of the same type. However, most of the time when we work with data we are dealing with **tabular** data, which contains many rows and columns. For example, below we have a data set with information on 1,000 employees from a software company. (For convenience we only display the first six rows of the data set.)\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, the **observations** (*i.e.*, the employees) form the rows of the data set, and the **variables** (*i.e.*, the characteristics of the employees we are measuring) form the columns. The **dimensions** of the data set are typically written as $n$ x $m$, where $n$ is the number of observations (or rows) and $m$ is the number of variables (or columns).\n",
