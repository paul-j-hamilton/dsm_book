Lexoo, a UK-based online marketplace for legal services, was facing the strategic choice of how to grow from early start-up to mature platform. Daniel van Binsbergen, Lexoo's CEO, and web developer Chris O'Sullivan, CTO, had set up Lexoo to help Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) to find legal advice at low prices. At the time of the case in 2018, Lexoo had just started attracting larger companies in need of specialized legal advice as new customers. Larger companies had higher value and more frequent needs. Lexoo could become their "go-to" place across a broad range of legal services. However, larger companies also required a more personalized approach and were more difficult to acquire than SMEs. Van Binsbergen and O'Sullivan were debating whether Lexoo should diversify to serve both SMEs and larger companies, or whether to pivot their focus toward larger companies altogether.

**Case Questions**

1. How would you recommend Daniel van Binsbergen (CEO) and Chris O’Sullivan (CTO) move forward with respect to SME and Enterprise customers? Should Lexoo focus on SME clients, Enterprise clients, or both? 
2. Imagine you had data on past transactions for each Lexoo customer, with information such as the time of the transaction, the legal area, whether it required an international lawyer, and the transaction price. (See Exhibit 3 in the case for an example of the data.) How would you use these data to guide your recommendation to Van Binsbergen and O’Sullivan?
3. What are the limitations of past transaction data to guide your recommendation? How would you address those limitations?
4. What other information would you take into account in making your recommendation?
