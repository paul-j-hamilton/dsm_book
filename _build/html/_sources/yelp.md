The case reveals how Yelp developed an internal experimentation platform and drove the adoption of an experimentation mindset to product development. Anchored on a pivotal decision on whether to release a new advertising policy that forces ads shown on map searches to adhere to the map's geographical constraints, the case illustrates the value of experimentation in informing decisions.

3. Based on qualitative evidence in the case and the quantitative analysis from class 11, what did Mathew learn from the Box Search Experiment? What should be his next steps?
