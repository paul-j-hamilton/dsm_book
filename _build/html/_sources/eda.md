# Exploring Data

One of the fundamental pillars of data science is to understand the data by visualizing it and computing basic descriptive summary statistics (*e.g.*, average, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum). This collection of techniques is typically referred to as **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**. Often, visualizing data is enough to answer basic descriptive questions (such as, which types of customers are buying different products?) devise more complex hypotheses about various relationships (such as, which types of customers are more likely to buy different products?) and identify irregularities (such as mistakes in the data collection or outlier data).

Descriptive statistics of key business metrics are aggregations of data that should form the information backbone of every enterprise. For example, sales, revenue, and customer churn are all examples of business metrics. Creating meaningful visualizations and analyzing descriptive statistics is the first important step in addressing business problems with data.

In this chapter, we will see how R can be used to explore and summarize data.
