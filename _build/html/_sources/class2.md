# Class 2: Assignment Sheet

**Before Class**

Read the *Data Science at Target* case [here]() and prepare the following case questions:
	+ The most basic description of the four areas on which Desai focused when he first joined Target suggest that even a small data science operation is a big investment in terms of hardware, talent, and organizational learning (case pages 2-3). Does it make sense for Target to hire Desai in 2013 to pursue data science as an important part of its strategy? What is the business case?
	+ How do you reconcile the “learning and experimentation” model of develop-test-measure with delivering “relevant” and “curated” content for on-line digital personalization?
	+ When Desai’s team first reached out to business units in search of questions where data science might be useful, he did not require them to utilize “big data” (*i.e.* look for patterns to explore in the data). Why not? Do you agree?
	+ Should business information analysts who are Enterprise Data, Analytics, and Business Intelligence (EDABI) Group’s primary customers be embedded in business units or sit closer to the data sciences group?
	+ Should the tools that EDABI develops be flexible or structured? What does an empowered managerial class mean for the data scientists and engineers building the tools?
