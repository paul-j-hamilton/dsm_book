    "# Two-Sample Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Although analyzing one sample of data is useful for problems like gauging public opinion or testing the stability of a manufacturing process, there are more advanced analyses which involve comparing the responses of two or more groups. This can be in the form of comparing means or comparing proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing Means\n",
    "\n",
    "Many business applications involve a comparison of two population means. For instance, a company may want to know if a new logo produces more sales than the previous logo, or a consumer group may want to test whether two major brands of food freezers differ in the average amount of electricity they use. In this section we extend our knowledge of hypothesis testing on one population mean to comparing two population means.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use these tests you need to have a sample from each of the two populations of interest. For the tests to be valid, the samples must be randomly selected. They can be either independent or dependent. This is an important distinction, because it determines which statistical method is used and how one controls for sources of variation. **Independent samples** are selected from each population separately. If we selected a random sample of customers of one domestic gas supplier and a random sample of customers from a rival gas supplier, the samples would be independent. **Dependent samples** consist of matched or paired values that are inherently related to each other. If we selected a sample of athletes and compared their pulse rates before and after an exercise routine, the samples would be paired, or dependent, because we drew the two samples of observations from the same set of athletes. This allows us to control for the variability between athletes and focus on the pulse rate difference in each individual due to the control condition (*i.e.*, the exercise routine). The choice of independent or dependent samples depends on the context of the test. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Independent Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "The independent samples t-test is used to compare the means of two independent samples. It can be used to test whether:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Biology graduates have a different average annual income than chemistry graduates.\n",
    "+ Length of life, on average, is shorter for never-married persons than for people who are or have been married.\n",
    "+ The mean years of schooling of Republicans is different than the mean years of schooling of Democrats. \n",
    "+ Men average more hours of sleep per night than women.\n",
    "+ The PE (price to earnings) ratio for tech stocks is on average higher than for financial services stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing two sample tests of means, the null hypothesis is always that the population means of the two groups are the same. Formally, if we denote $\\mu_1$ the population mean of group 1 and $\\mu_2$ the population mean of group 2, our null hypothesis is $H_o:\\mu_1=\\mu_2$. There are three possible alternative hypotheses one can test, as listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Alternative Hypothesis | Terminology |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| $H_{a} :\\mu_{1} -\\mu_{2}$ < 0 | Left-sided |\n",
    "| $H_{a} :\\mu_{1} -\\mu_{2}$ > 0 | Right-sided | \n",
    "| $H_{a} :\\mu_{1} -\\mu_{2} \\ne$ 0 | Two-sided | \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, the General Social Survey (GSS, link [here](http://gss.norc.org/)) has been tracking American attitudes on a wide variety of topics. With the exception of the U.S. Census, the GSS is the most frequently used source of information about American society. The surveys are now conducted every other year and measure hundreds of variables on thousands of observations. We have this data loaded into a data frame called `gss`:"

We can't analyze these data as two independent samples because we have two measurements (pairs of data) on the same individual. We need to adjust our hypothesis test to account for the fact that the measurements are correlated. \n",

In the other trial, each of the same 20 participants drank a bottle of the carbohydrate-protein formula. At the end of the two trials, the distance each participant ran (in km) was recorded.

    "The evidence seems to imply that the carb-protein drink resulted in greater distances than the carb-only drink. Why did the two-sample t-test conclude that there was not a difference between the two drinks?\n",
    "\n",
    "The two-sample t-test described earlier requires that the two samples be independent and random, and thus is not the right statistical test procedure for this example. Certainly, the independence requirement was violated by the manner in which the experiment was conducted. Each pair of measurements, a carb-only distance and carb-protein distance, is associated with the same runner. A glance at the data will show that the distances are of approximately the same magnitude for a particular runner, but vary from one runner to another. This, of course, is exactly what we might expect. Distance run, in a large part, is determined by a runner's stamina and muscle mass. Since each runner had a different physical ability, we might expect a large amount of variability in the distance run from one runner to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are interested in performance variability due to the drink and not runner variability, we must conduct a **paired difference test**. This test eliminates the effect of the runner-to-runner variability and yields more information on the mean difference in the distances run for the two drink types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, a paired t-test is easy to run. All we need to do is add a `paired` argument to the `t.test()` command as follows:"
