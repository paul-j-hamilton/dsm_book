    "If we want to compare the means of more than two groups, one procedure available is called **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**. The name seems strange because we are comparing means, but the word variance comes from the fact that this procedure makes a relatively strong assumption that the variability in each group we are comparing is the same. A rule of thumb when using ANOVA is that the ratio of the largest standard deviation of the groups to the smallest standard deviation should be no more than three.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis for ANOVA is that the means of all our groups are the same. The alternative is that there are at least two groups that have different means. If we reject the null hypothesis we need to do further analyses to see where the differences exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand when one might use ANOVA, consider the following example. Builder's Buddy, a nationwide home improvement chain, would like to not only sell you a water heater, they would also like to install it for you. The four service centers the company runs are organized by regional markets. One question of interest is whether the employees’ training is similar in the four different markets so that the install time is roughly consistent around the country. Builder's Buddy collected data from these four different markets on the amount of time it took (in minutes) to install a standard 40-gallon water heater. That data is saved in a data frame called `waterData`, and the first few observations are shown below:"

For example, if one ran three hypothesis tests at the same time, the overall Type I error would increase from 5% to 14%, even though each individual test is done at the 5% level. There are corrections to p-values that can be applied when performing multiple tests to correct for this issue.
