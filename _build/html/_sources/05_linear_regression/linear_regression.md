# Linear Regression

Relationships between variables are often at the heart of what we’d like to learn from data. This chapter covers **linear regression analysis**, a statistical method that is used to estimate the relationship between a continuous dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This technique can be used to answer such questions as:

+ Is there a relationship between movie box office performance and advertising spend?
+ Do countries with higher GDPs have lower infant mortality rates?
+ What is the relationship between a given stock’s return and the returns of the S&P 500?
