    "# Confidence Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the previous section, we often want to use sample data to estimate population quantities. Due to the randomness inherent to sampling, an observed sample statistic is almost certainly not equal to the true population parameter. To quantify the variability surrounding the sample statistic, we can compute a **confidence interval** which provides a lower and upper bound for where we think the true population value lies. Note that unless we take a sample which consists of the entire population (often called a census), we will never know the true population parameter with absolute certainty.\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose that in a survey of one hundred adult cell phone users, 30% switched carriers in the past two years. Based on this sample statistic, what can we conclude about the entire population of adult cell phone users? Our sample estimate of 30% is based on a random sample of one hundred users and not the entire population, so we cannot conclude that the true population parameter is 30%. Instead, we must calculate a confidence interval to understand the range of plausible values for the population proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In R, we can calculate a confidence interval for proportions with the `binom.test()` command, which uses the following syntax:\n",
