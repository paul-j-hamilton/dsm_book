# Course Roadmap


```{div} full-width
The next section (***Assignment Sheets***) contains complete instructions for each class session. Typically, the assignment for each class includes a combination of:

1. *Readings*, to introduce new data science concepts;
2. *Exercises*, which allow you to practice implementing those data science concepts in R; 
3. *Quizzes*, which test your knowledge of those data science concepts; and
4. *Case studies*, which allow you to apply what you've learned in a managerial setting. 
	+ For some classes, you will read a case beforehand and we will work through the analyses together during class (*e.g.* Class 4). For other classes, you will prepare the analyses for the case beforehand as part of your preparation for our case discussion (*e.g.* Class 6). The assignment page for each case in this book will make this clear.

Throughout the book, certain materials are marked optional with (&#9909;). This flags content that you are not responsible for in the DSM course, but which may be helpful in future courses or in your future career as a manager.
