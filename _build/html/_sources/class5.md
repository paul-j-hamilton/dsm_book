# Class 5: Assignment Sheet

**Before Class**

1. Work through the [*Samples & Populations*](samps_pops.html#samples-&-populations) section of the book.
2. Work through the [*Hypothesis Testing*](hyp_testing.html#hypothesis-testing) section of the book, including the embedded exercise and quiz. 
	+ Note that you do *not* need to work through the optional sections.
3. Read the [*Lexoo: Building a Long-Lasting Platform (Abridged)*](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/tu/4cb23086) case and prepare the following case questions:
	+ How would you recommend Daniel van Binsbergen (CEO) and Chris O’Sullivan (CTO) move forward with respect to SME and Enterprise customers? Should Lexoo focus on SME clients, Enterprise clients, or both? 
	+ Imagine you had data on past transactions for each Lexoo customer, with information such as the time of the transaction, the legal area, whether it required an international lawyer, and the transaction price. (See Exhibit 3 in the case for an example of the data.) How would you use these data to guide your recommendation to Van Binsbergen and O’Sullivan?
	+ What are the limitations of past transaction data to guide your recommendation? How would you address those limitations?
	+ What other information would you take into account in making your recommendation?
