# Class 0: Assignment Sheet

1. Complete the poll in [***Access to Materials***](access.html#access-to-materials) so that you have full access to the course materials. This step will require that you create a Google account, if you do not have one already. 

2. Some time before our second class, work through the ***R BOOTCAMP*** section of the book. This will introduce you to the basics of R.
	+ The DSM course is designed for students from all backgrounds, including those with extensive coding experience and those with no coding experience at all. For students coming into the course with less experience, the R Bootcamp is designed to framiliarize you with the basics of coding in R. The fundamentals introduced in the bootcamp will form the foundation for the skills you will learn throughout the course. 
	+ To get credit for the bootcamp, you must complete the three quizzes embedded throughout ([here](rbasics_quiz1.html#quiz-#1), [here](rbasics_quiz2.html#quiz-#2), and [here](df_manipulation_quiz.html#quiz)). If you already have experience with the basics of R you do not need to work through the bootcamp, but you must still submit these quizzes.
