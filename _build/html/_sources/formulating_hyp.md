# Formulating Hypotheses

Hypothesis testing consists of setting up two hypotheses, called the **null hypothesis** ($H_{o}$) and the **alternative hypothesis** ($H_{a}$). It is important to note that these hypotheses must be formulated *before* any data are observed. In the one-sample case, the null hypothesis specifies a specific value of the population parameter of interest. In the one-sample barista example above, the null hypothesis would be that on average, the barista pours twelve ounces of coffee. In the two-sample case, the null hypothesis specifies that the two parameters of interest are equal. In the two-sample barista example above, the null hypothesis would be that on average, the two baristas pour the same amount of coffee. 

The alternative hypothesis in the one-sample case expresses how the population parameter may differ from the value specified in the null. In some cases, we simply hope to test whether the population parameter is *not equal* to the value specified in the null; this is referred to as a **two-sided** test because we will reject the null hypothesis if the finding from the sample is sufficiently greater than or less than the specified value. In other cases, we hope to test whether the population parameter is *greater than* (or *less than*) the value specified in the null; these are referred to as **right-sided** (and **left-sided**) tests, respectively. For example, in the one-sample barista example the alternative is that the true average amount poured is not equal to twelve ounces, so we would run a two-sided test. If we wanted to specifically test whether our barista pours *more than* twelve ounces, we would run a right-sided test. 

For the two-sample case, a two-sided alternative hypothesis would state that the two population parameters are not equal. The right-sided alternative hypothesis would state that the population one parameter is greater than the population two parameter, and the left-sided alternative hypothesis would state the opposite. In the two-sample two-sided barista example, the alternative is that the two baristas do not pour the same amount, on average. If we wanted to test whether the home barista poured more than the work barista, we would run a right-sided test (or a left-sided test, depending on which barista we arbitrarily assign as 1).
