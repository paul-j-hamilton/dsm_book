    "# Confidence Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the previous section, we often want to use sample data to estimate population quantities. Due to the randomness inherent to sampling, an observed sample statistic is almost certainly not equal to the true population parameter. To quantify the variability surrounding the sample statistic, we can compute a **confidence interval** which provides a lower and upper bound for where we think the true population value lies. Note that unless we take a sample which consists of the entire population (often called a census), we will never know the true population parameter with absolute certainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Confidence Intervals for Proportions\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that in a survey of one hundred adult cell phone users, 30% switched carriers in the past two years. Based on this sample statistic (which we denote $\\hat{p}$), what can we conclude about the proportion of all adult cell phone users who switched carriers (which we denote $p$)? Our sample estimate of $\\hat{p} = 30%$ is based on a random sample of one hundred users and not the entire population, so we cannot conclude that the true population parameter is $p = 30%$. Instead, we must calculate a confidence interval to understand the range of plausible values for the population proportion $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For proportions, we generally use the following formula to calculate a confidence interval from our sample estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{p} \\pm z^\\ast \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{p}$ is our estimate from the sample, $n$ is the number of observations in the sample, and $z^\\ast$ is a constant that determines our desired level of confidence in the interval (we typically use a value of 1.96, which corresponds to a 95% level of confidence). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine we wanted to construct a 95% confidence interval based on our sample of one hundred cell phone users. Applying the above formula:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that we can adjust our desired level of confidence by changing the value of $z^\\ast$. For example, imagine we only desired 80% confidence in our interval estimate. In this case, we would apply the same formula but use a $z^\\ast$ value of 1.28.\n",

    "Now suppose that in our sample of one hundred adult cell phone users, we also asked them to rate their satisfaction with their most recent service provider on a continuous scale from one to ten. In this sample, the average rating was 6.72 with a standard deviation of 1.72. Based on this sample statistic (which we denote $\\bar{x}$), what can we conclude about the average level of satisfaction among the entire population of adult cell phone users (which we denote $\\mu$)? Our sample estimate of $\\bar{x} = 6.72$ is based on a random sample of one hundred users and not the entire population, so we cannot conclude that the true population parameter is $\\mu = 6.72$. Instead, we must calculate a confidence interval to understand the range of plausible values for the population mean $\\mu$.\n",

    "Unlike the z^\\ast from the previous section, the value $t^\\ast$ depends on both our desired level of confidence and something called the **degrees of freedom** of the test. In the case of confidence intervals for means, the degrees of freedom is simply the sample size ($n$) minus one. To determine the appropriate value of $t^{\\ast}$ for our 95% confidence interval, we therefore need to look up the value of $t^{\\ast}$ that corresponds to a confidence level of 0.95 with 99 degrees of freedom. This can be done by searching the web for a calculator that returns the appropriate value of $t^{\\ast}$ based on our degrees of freedom and confidence level; in this case, the value is approximately 1.98. Note that in practice, one would often use statistical software (such as the R or Python programming languages, SPSS, Excel, etc.) to calculate confidence intervals instead of calculating them by hand. These packages determine the appropriate value of $t^{\\ast}$ for you behind the scenes, so you will rarely need to look it up yourself. \n",
