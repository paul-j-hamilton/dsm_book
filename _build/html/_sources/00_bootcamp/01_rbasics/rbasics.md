# R Basics

This chapter provides an introduction to the very basics of R (and coding in general). By the end, you will be familiar with all of the following concepts:

+ R as a Calculator
+ Assignment
+ Data Types
+ Atomic Vectors
+ Functions

If you already have experience with coding and/or the R language, you may skip this chapter. However, you must still successfully complete the quizzes throughout to get credit.

```{warning}
To get credit for the R Bootcamp, you must complete the three quizzes throughout this section ([R Basics](rbasics.html#r-basics)) and the next ([Data Frames](../02_dataframes/dataframes.html#data-frames)).
```
