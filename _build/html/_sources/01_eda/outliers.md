# Outliers

In statistics, there is not a formally precise nor universally accepted definition of outliers. An **outlier** is simply a value or data object that is far away or very different from all or most of the other data. Outliers can correspond to erroneous data coming from wrong measurements or data entry errors. However, outliers can also be correct data that differ from the rest of the data just by chance or for other exceptional situations. Even if outliers are correct data, it might be worthwhile to exclude them from the data set for further analysis and to consider them separately. Some data analysis methods are robust against outliers and (more or less) not influenced by them, whereas others are extremely sensitive to outliers and might produce incoherent or nonsense results just because of the presence of one or a few outliers. 

For a categorical variable, we often consider the unique set of values. An outlier is a value that occurs with a frequency extremely lower than the frequency of all other values. However, in some cases, this might actually be the target of our analysis.
For quantitative variables, outlier detection is more difficult. We have already classified certain data points in a boxplot as outliers (see [Boxplots](../01_eda/visualization.html#boxplots)), which is one of the simplest outlier detection methods. However, the definition of outliers in a boxplot does not take the number of observations into account, so that for larger data sets, boxplots will usually contain points marked as outliers. Usually, what we consider as an outlier depends on the data generating process.
