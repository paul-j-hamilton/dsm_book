    "One of the fundamental pillars of data science is to understand the data by visualizing it and computing basic descriptive summary statistics (*e.g.*, average, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum). This collection of techniques is typically referred to as **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**. Often, visualizing data is enough to answer basic descriptive questions (such as, which types of customers are buying different products?) devise more complex hypotheses about various relationships (such as, which types of customers are more likely to buy different products?) and identify irregularities (such as mistakes in the data collection or outlier data).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Why is this important?\n",
    "The main purpose of EDA is to help look at data before making any assumptions. It can help identify obvious errors, as well as better understand patterns within the data, detect outliers or anomalous events, find interesting relations among the variables. Data scientists can use exploratory analysis to ensure the results they produce are valid and applicable to any desired business outcomes and goals. EDA also helps stakeholders by confirming they are asking the right questions. EDA can help answer questions about standard deviations, categorical variables, and confidence intervals. Once EDA is complete and insights are drawn, its features can then be used for more sophisticated data analysis or modeling, including machine learning.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics of key business metrics are aggregations of data that should form the information backbone of every enterprise. For example, sales, revenue, and customer churn are all examples of business metrics. Creating meaningful visualizations and analyzing descriptive statistics is the first important step in addressing business problems with data.\n",
