Orchadio, a direct-to-consumer grocery business, needs to conduct its first two A/B tests—one to evaluate the effectiveness and functioning of its newly redesigned website, and one to market-test four versions of a new banner for the website. To do so, it will rely on a technology management platform designed by Split Software, whose feature flags allow Orchadio engineers to (1) turn specific software features on and off and (2) to limit access to those features to specific groups of website visitors. These capabilities in turn enable A/B feature testing. Split also offers data analytics to allow Orchadio to assess how its tests affect a plethora of Orchadio’s business, software, and operating metrics. Orchadio managers now need to decide how to design their experiments for maximum impact, including whether or how to sequence them.

**Case Questions**

1. Why do companies run A/B tests? What about phased releases? 
2. How should Lewis sequence the two experiments?
3. How do the four steps to designing an experiment apply to the Liu’s banner experiment? What about Anuja’s? Are the overall evaluation criteria the same for both experiments? What about the guardrail metrics?
