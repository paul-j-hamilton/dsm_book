# R as a Calculator

At its most basic, R can be used as a calculator. As you would expect, you can use all the standard mathematical operators:

+ Addition (`+`) & Subtraction (`-`)
+ Multiplication (`*`) & Division (`/`)
+ Exponentiation (`^`)

```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-output]
2 + 2
```

```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-input]
print(2 + 2)
```

```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-output]
100 / 20
```

```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-input]
print(100 / 20)
```

```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-output]
3 ^ 3
```

```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-input]
print(3 ^ 3)
```

Of course, R is much more than a simple calculator! In the following sections, you'll learn the building blocks of R that we'll rely on throughout the entire course.
