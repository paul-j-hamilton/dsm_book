# **Case Study:** Data Science at Target

<br>

This case follows Paritosh Desai in his journey to build a data science operation at Target, a nationally known retailer. When Desai joined Target.com in 2013 it was awash in rich, fine-grained data that could provide any number of benefits if analyzed or harnessed in service of its customers. Using his technical and organizational knowledge, he assumed the role of VP of Business Intelligence, Analytics & Testing. There he explored how the retailer could use its relatively small, but thriving e-commerce art to drive sales and win customers.

The challenges were mostly technical: how to deliver customers relevant recommendations in milliseconds?! The team adopted an iterative approach to doing data science and to learn constantly during the process. That and its focus on the customer generated positive results. His team of data scientists successfully tackled both components needed to deliver personalized recommendations: (1) the data processing infrastructure to analyze and produce recommendations and (2) the mobile customer experiences on the front end. After a year and half, leadership promoted Desai to SVP of Enterprise Data, Analytics, and Business Intelligence at Target Corporation.

In this new role his task was to integrate data science capabilities into the retailer's extensive brick and mortar operation. At Target Corp., Desai faced a whole new set of challenges organizational and cultural in nature. Choices around technology had organizational implications as well as technical ones that created tradeoffs to consider. Resistance to adoption of data driven tools among business unit analysts and managers on the ground would sink the effort. Finding ways to get buy in from skilled and experienced managers not “raised” in a culture of data science was as pressing as the technological questions.

**Case Questions**

1. The most basic description of the four areas on which Desai focused when he first joined Target suggest that even a small data science operation is a big investment in terms of hardware, talent, and organizational learning (case pages 2-3). Does it make sense for Target to hire Desai in 2013 to pursue data science as an important part of its strategy? What is the business case?
2. How do you reconcile the “learning and experimentation” model of develop-test-measure with delivering “relevant” and “curated” content for on-line digital personalization?
3. When Desai’s team first reached out to business units in search of questions where data science might be useful, he did not require them to utilize “big data” (*i.e.* look for patterns to explore in the data). Why not? Do you agree?
4. Should business information analysts who are Enterprise Data, Analytics, and Business Intelligence (EDABI) Group’s primary customers be embedded in business units or sit closer to the data sciences group?
5. Should the tools that EDABI develops be flexible or structured? What does an empowered managerial class mean for the data scientists and engineers building the tools?
